    <div style="margin-left:200px; margin-right:200px;"><p>My mother LOVES gardening, and my dad and I have an interest in photography. Also I'm trying to showcase my newfound skills in web development, hence this website which manges to complete all 3 tasks. </p>
    	<p>All the photos in here are indeed from our own garden, and these are only a sample from the plethora of pictures my father and I have managed to save in 5 years. Most were grown from our prepared seeds, and some were bought from the nursery(whose link has been shared in the map). Also please note that the phone number, the address and reviews are not real, and we do not deliver!! The making of this website was for educational purposes only. </p>
